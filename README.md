# OroSyncBundle

OroSyncBundle uses [GosWebSocketBundle](https://github.com/GeniusesOfSymfony/WebSocketBundle) to enable real-time websocket notifications between an Oro application server and users' browsers.

Out-of-the-box, OroSyncBundle triggers flash notifications about the outdated content if several users try to edit the same entity record simultaneously. It also sends flash notifications to all application site visitors once a developer turns on the system maintenance mode by a console's CLI tool.

Fore more information, please see [online SyncBundle documentation](https://doc.oroinc.com/backend/bundles/platform/SyncBundle/).
